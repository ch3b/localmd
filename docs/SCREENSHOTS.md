# Screenshots

Add these files to `docs/screenshots/`:

1. `start-screen-light.png`
2. `reader-screen-light.png`
3. `start-screen-dark.png`
4. `reader-screen-dark.png`

Tips:

- Capture only the app window (no full desktop).
- Use a consistent window size across all screenshots.
- Keep text legible and avoid overlapping OS dialogs.
